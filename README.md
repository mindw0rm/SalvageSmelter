# SalvageSmelter
Bukkit plugin to allow smelting armor and tools to raw materials.

This is a fork of the [original version from andrepl](https://github.com/andrepl/SalvageSmelter). 
The only changes are that it works (only?) with minecraft version 1.13.2.

Also, since this is not the official version, the updater has been removed.
